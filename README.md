# Contingency_table_R

This repository contains examples of contingency tables with coloured tiles (average, count, sum). The data used are randomized rows of 12900 responses of household survey conducted for the [Urban Transport Modelling for Sustainable Well-Being in Hanoi](https://urban-analytics.github.io/UTM-Hanoi/intro.html) project. Since the rows of each column are randomized, the below tables demonstrate a visualization technique but not the findings of the survey. 

Acknowledgements to [Eric Wanjau](https://github.com/R-icntay) for randomizing the survey responses and [Lex Comber](https://github.com/lexcomber) for the exploratory data analysis script that served as a starting point for these contingency tables.
